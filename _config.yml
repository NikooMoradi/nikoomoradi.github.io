          My Signals and Systems course project
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          In this project, I investigated Phase Locking Value(PLV) and other phase amplitude coupling metrics such as Modulation Index(MI), in the context of olfactory stimulation to assess their potential as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, using MATLAB and EEGLAB library.
