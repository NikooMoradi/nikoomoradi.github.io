          My AI and Biological Computation course project
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              In this project, we aimed to investigate the impact of feature extraction and selection on the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. We utilized time and frequency domain features of EEG signals, normalized and initially selected through Fisher score, and further optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Training both networks with these selected features under 5-fold cross-validation, we compared the outcomes to highlight the PSO algorithmâ€™s efficiency in refining feature selection. This approach demonstrated the importance of targeted feature selection in improving neural network accuracy, offering a valuable strategy for future AI applications in complex data analysis scenarios.

          High school was where I laid the groundwork for my academic path. It's where I learned about teamwork, time management, and handling pressure. Fond memories and the importance of work-life balance were part of the package.

          Besides hitting the books, I was a memeber of Badminton and Basketball team and I actively participated in Art Competitions.
